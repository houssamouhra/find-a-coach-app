## Recommended IDE Setup

_This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite._

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Vue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh

```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
